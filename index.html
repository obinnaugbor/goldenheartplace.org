                It is an annual gathering of multi-disciplinary facilitators and youths across ethno-religious
                 divides under one roof during Independence celebrations. The aim is to rekindle and renew the hopes and visions 
                 of the youths as well as equip them with the skills and tools they need to eke a living, make a difference and become
                 change agents.
                From a humble beginning of about a 1000 youths gathered at our maiden event, the summit is in excess of 50,000 gathering 
                annually with support from relevant public and private sector bodies. Every year, thousands of youths are given a lifeline in trainings,
                 mentorships, certifications, skills, and credit facilities to go better their lot and make a change on the continent at large.

                    GHF is committed to hunting, discovering and empowering the youths within Nigeria and the African continent. It is in this regard,
                     that the Foundation has established its Golden Heart Foundation Executive Education to develop the right people with the right skills/capacity
                      and values /capabilities for sustainable development or growth of a society.
                    The Executive Education flagship programme is the “Train the Trainee” program. 
                    The program offers a multifaceted learning experience subdivided into two phases which are Sector or industry specific courses (Short term -3 days)
                     and comprehensive certificate courses (Long term- 7days). The comprehensive courses are in three levels; Basic/Learner (1 week), Advanced/ Intermediary (2weeks),

                    <p>
                        One in every five out of the worlds out-of-school children is in Nigeria according to UNICEF. This is a ticking time bomb and has placed a sense of urgency
                         on all those concerned. AT GHF, we are not only concerned, but have taken steps to reverse this by collaborating with our partners to create free schools across the country.
                        In these challenging times, the aim is to help poor families meet school costs for their wards and children. This program equips pupils and students in schools with 
                        necessary tools to start a new school year in addition to tuition. Items such as school uniforms, shoes, school bags, stationery and other educational materials are distributed by GHF
                         through Partnerships with corporate organizations and kind-hearted individuals.
                        We support schools across Nigeria, with a view to replicating some on the continent at large in collaboration with various partners to give less privileged kids 
                        access to good quality education. The aim is to help shape citizens who are healthier, more productive, and active within their communities.

                            The Chinese proverb that says, give a man fish and he will eat for a day, teach him how to fish and you will give him an occupation to feed him for a lifetime 
                            is not in doubt. With this in mind, vocational trainings have been designed to arm poorly educated youths and widows with the skills they need to fend for themselves
                             and take care of their families. Hence, keeping them away from crime.
